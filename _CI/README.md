# _CI — Workflow Tooling

A portable, vendored CI/CD framework built on [Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/).
All dependencies ship in `lib/vendor/`, so `./workflow.cmd` works immediately after clone — no global installs required.

## Design Principles

**Modular by concern.** Each task module owns one domain (lint, test, build, security, etc.) and exposes an Invoke `Collection` namespace. Modules never reach into each other's internals — they compose via `run_steps()` or direct function calls.

**Run-once bootstrap.** A sentinel file (`_CI/.bootstrapped`) ensures first-time setup (pre-commit installation, etc.) runs exactly once. Every task inherits bootstrap as an Invoke `pre` task, so it triggers automatically on first use and is a no-op thereafter. Pass `--force` to re-run.

**CI-aware.** Bootstrap steps declare a `ci_behavior` (`'run'` or `'skip'`). When the `CI` environment variable is set (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), interactive prompts are suppressed and steps execute or skip accordingly.

**Fail-last reporting.** `run_steps()` runs all steps even if earlier ones fail, then reports every failure before raising `SystemExit(1)`. No silent swallowing, no short-circuiting.

**Visual feedback.** The `@logged(name)` decorator emits pass/fail status per step, making terminal output scannable at a glance.

**Cross-platform.** The `workflow.cmd` launcher is a polyglot script — sh on Unix/macOS, cmd.exe on Windows — that delegates to the vendored Invoke CLI via `uv run`.

## Interface

All commands are invoked via `./workflow.cmd <namespace>.<task>`. Running a namespace without a task name executes its default.

```

## Shared Utilities (`tasks/shared.py`)

| Utility | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `execute(ctx, cmd)` | Run a shell command; raise `SystemExit(1)` on failure |
| `@run(cmd)` | Decorator — replace function body with a shell command |
| `@logged(name)` | Decorator — print pass/fail status after execution |
| `run_steps(*fns)` | Run all steps, accumulate failures, raise once at the end |

## Configuration (`tasks/configuration.py`)

Centralized constants shared across task modules:

| Constant | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `PATHS` | Standard directories targeted by linters/formatters: `src/ _CI/tasks/ tests/` |
| `SECURITY_OVERRIDE_ENV` | Environment variable name for security audit overrides |
| `IGNORE_PATTERN` | Regex for parsing vulnerability IDs with optional expiry dates |
| `IMAGE_NAME` / `ACT_IMAGE_NAME` | Container image names for deps cache and act |
| `QA_WORKFLOW` | Path to the CI workflow YAML |
| `PYSCN_REPORTS_DIR` | Directory for pyscn HTML reports |
| `SENTINEL` | Bootstrap sentinel file path |

## Bootstrap Framework (`tasks/bootstrap.py`)

New setup steps are added by appending to the `STEPS` list:

```python
STEPS: list[BootstrapStep] = [
    BootstrapStep(
        name='pre-commit hooks',
        action=install_pre_commit,
        prompt='Install pre-commit hooks? [y/N] ',
        ci_behavior='skip',  # 'run' or 'skip' in CI
    ),
    # Add more steps here
]
```

Each step has a `prompt` for local interactive use and a `ci_behavior` for unattended execution.
